# DSYS
___
A beginner-friendly java library designed to help with tedious tasks.

### Installation
In IntelliJ:
- Create a new project from version control
- Paste the link for this repo into the 'URL' field.
```
https://github.com/Newman-Advanced-CS/DSYS
```
- IntelliJ will create a new project with DSYS installed (it will be identical to this repository).
- To avoid issues, immediately refactor the name of your working directory from "DSYS" to whatever your actual project name is (see below).

or [download the library directly](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FNewman-Advanced-CS%2FDSYS%2Ftree%2Fmaster%2Fsrc) and place it into your current project.
